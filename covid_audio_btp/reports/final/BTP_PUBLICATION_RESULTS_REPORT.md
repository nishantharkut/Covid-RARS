# COVID Audio BTP Final Results Report

## Executive Position

The implementation supports a defensible BTP and potential robustness-oriented publication story. It is not a clinically deployable diagnostic model. It does not support claiming clinical deployment. The strongest finding is that internal audio performance can look promising while external transfer, confounding, and calibration analyses reveal major reliability limits.

## Pipeline Architecture

The pipeline is organized as an evidence-first audio ML workflow:

1. Build cleaned Coswara metadata, quality labels, participant-level splits, and audio features.
2. Train internal audio baselines and calibrated fusion models on leakage-controlled splits.
3. Compare handcrafted and learned representations: MFCC, OpenSMILE eGeMAPSv02, BEATs, and PANNs CNN14.
4. Evaluate source-trained models on COUGHVID as external transfer validation.
5. Run COUGHVID internal baselines to separate representation capacity from dataset shift.
6. Audit metadata confounding, then evaluate quality-weighted audio after inverse-propensity weighting.
7. Report clinical operating points and calibration-under-shift to avoid relying only on AUROC.
8. Add Tier-2 strengthening analyses: dataset-domain separability, IPW sensitivity, prevalence recalibration, and paired bootstrap comparisons.

This architecture supports a robustness and external-validation study. It does not support a clinical-deployment claim.

## Decision Log

- MFCC was retained as the traditional handcrafted baseline because it anchors the project against the original pipeline.
- OpenSMILE eGeMAPSv02 was added as a stronger handcrafted clinical-acoustic baseline.
- BEATs was selected as the main general-audio learned embedding model because it directly tests whether modern transformer audio representations help.
- PANNs CNN14 was added as the CNN audio-embedding comparison, so representation architecture is not reduced to a single transformer result.
- wav2vec2 was treated as a lower-priority speech-biased option because the current scientific question is cough/audio representation robustness, not speech recognition transfer.
- External validation was prioritized over leaderboard tuning because Coswara-to-COUGHVID transfer is the central generalization test.
- Metadata confounding, IPW control, operating points, and calibration shift were added because medical-audio claims require reliability and bias checks, not only accuracy metrics.
- Domain-shift classification, IPW sensitivity, prevalence recalibration, and paired bootstrap comparisons were added to make the robustness story harder to dismiss as a single-analysis artifact.

## Quantitative Results

- Best external transfer: auroc=0.553.
- Best COUGHVID internal baseline: auroc=0.781.
- Strongest metadata-only confounding audit: auroc=0.964.
- IPW-controlled audio: auroc=0.780.

## Interpretation

The current evidence does not show a deployable COVID screening model. The stronger and more defensible interpretation is that internal audio models can learn label-associated signal, but external transfer and calibration degrade substantially across datasets. The contrast between internal COUGHVID performance and Coswara-to-COUGHVID transfer supports domain shift as a central finding.

The metadata audits are especially important: symptoms, demographics, recording protocol, and related metadata predict the label strongly. Therefore, any audio-only claim must be framed as association under measured controls rather than as a causal COVID biomarker.

## Novelty

The novelty is not a new neural architecture. The contribution is a controlled, evidence-driven evaluation layer around COVID audio classification:

- Direct comparison of traditional handcrafted, stronger handcrafted, transformer audio, and CNN audio representations.
- Explicit internal versus external validation contrast on Coswara and COUGHVID.
- Metadata-only confounding audit showing how non-audio variables can explain labels.
- Inverse-propensity weighted controlled audio evaluation.
- Clinical operating-point reporting instead of AUROC-only reporting.
- Calibration-under-shift analysis showing that external probabilities should not be interpreted as calibrated risk.
- Dataset-domain separability audit showing whether learned representations encode source artifacts.
- IPW sensitivity analysis across stricter weight caps and clipping choices.
- External prevalence-recalibration analysis separating probability inflation from discrimination collapse.
- Paired bootstrap comparisons to avoid overinterpreting small model-ranking differences.

## Publication Readiness

This is BTP-ready if presented as a rigorous negative/robustness study. It is not ready as a clinical diagnostic or high-accuracy detector paper.

Defensible claim: COVID audio models can perform well internally, but measured metadata confounding and cross-dataset shift substantially weaken external validity; robust reporting requires external validation, confounding audits, operating points, and calibration analysis.

Non-defensible claim: this system is ready for clinical diagnosis, screening deployment, or individual health decision-making.

## Limitations

- External transfer remains weak, so deployment claims are not supported.
- IPW control addresses measured confounders only; unmeasured confounding may remain.
- COUGHVID and Coswara labels, collection protocols, and class prevalences differ.
- IPW sensitivity still controls only measured confounders; unmeasured device, prompt-following, and room-acoustic effects may remain.
- Domain-shift classification shows separability, not the complete causal source of shift.
- Related-paper quantitative comparison still needs careful citation formatting based on the exact papers from the original document.
- The current system is a research prototype, not a medical device.

## Remaining Work

1. Run the Tier-2 strengthening scripts and regenerate the paper tables, evidence matrix, manifest, and final report.
2. Convert this report into the final BTP manuscript sections.
3. Keep the central claim conservative: robustness analysis, not clinical deployment.
4. Archive final artifacts and Git tags after the final report and related-paper table are frozen.
