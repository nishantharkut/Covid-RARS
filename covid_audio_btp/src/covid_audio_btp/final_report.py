The pipeline is organized as an evidence-first audio ML workflow:

1. Build cleaned Coswara metadata, quality labels, participant-level splits, and audio features.
2. Train internal audio baselines and calibrated fusion models on leakage-controlled splits.
3. Compare handcrafted and learned representations: MFCC, OpenSMILE eGeMAPSv02, BEATs, and PANNs CNN14.
4. Evaluate source-trained models on COUGHVID as external transfer validation.
5. Run COUGHVID internal baselines to separate representation capacity from dataset shift.
6. Audit metadata confounding, then evaluate quality-weighted audio after inverse-propensity weighting.
7. Report clinical operating points and calibration-under-shift to avoid relying only on AUROC.
8. Add Tier-2 strengthening analyses: dataset-domain separability, IPW sensitivity, prevalence recalibration, and paired bootstrap comparisons.

This architecture supports a robustness and external-validation study. It does not support a clinical-deployment claim.
"""


def _decision_log_section() -> str:

- MFCC was retained as the traditional handcrafted baseline because it anchors the project against the original pipeline.
- OpenSMILE eGeMAPSv02 was added as a stronger handcrafted clinical-acoustic baseline.
- BEATs was selected as the main general-audio learned embedding model because it directly tests whether modern transformer audio representations help.
- PANNs CNN14 was added as the CNN audio-embedding comparison, so representation architecture is not reduced to a single transformer result.
- wav2vec2 was treated as a lower-priority speech-biased option because the current scientific question is cough/audio representation robustness, not speech recognition transfer.
- External validation was prioritized over leaderboard tuning because Coswara-to-COUGHVID transfer is the central generalization test.
- Metadata confounding, IPW control, operating points, and calibration shift were added because medical-audio claims require reliability and bias checks, not only accuracy metrics.
- Domain-shift classification, IPW sensitivity, prevalence recalibration, and paired bootstrap comparisons were added to make the robustness story harder to dismiss as a single-analysis artifact.

The current evidence does not show a deployable COVID screening model. The stronger and more defensible interpretation is that internal audio models can learn label-associated signal, but external transfer and calibration degrade substantially across datasets. The contrast between internal COUGHVID performance and Coswara-to-COUGHVID transfer supports domain shift as a central finding.

The metadata audits are especially important: symptoms, demographics, recording protocol, and related metadata predict the label strongly. Therefore, any audio-only claim must be framed as association under measured controls rather than as a causal COVID biomarker.

The novelty is not a new neural architecture. The contribution is a controlled, evidence-driven evaluation layer around COVID audio classification:

- Direct comparison of traditional handcrafted, stronger handcrafted, transformer audio, and CNN audio representations.
- Explicit internal versus external validation contrast on Coswara and COUGHVID.
- Metadata-only confounding audit showing how non-audio variables can explain labels.
- Inverse-propensity weighted controlled audio evaluation.
- Clinical operating-point reporting instead of AUROC-only reporting.
- Calibration-under-shift analysis showing that external probabilities should not be interpreted as calibrated risk.
- Dataset-domain separability audit showing whether learned representations encode source artifacts.
- IPW sensitivity analysis across stricter weight caps and clipping choices.
- External prevalence-recalibration analysis separating probability inflation from discrimination collapse.
- Paired bootstrap comparisons to avoid overinterpreting small model-ranking differences.

The final paper should compare against the exact related papers listed in the original project document. That comparison should be filled from a structured related-paper table, not from memory. Until that table is added, the correct qualitative comparison is:

- Many COVID audio papers emphasize internal validation or single-dataset performance.
- This work emphasizes external validation, measured confounding, calibration, and operating-point behavior.
- Therefore the paper should not claim higher accuracy than prior work; it should claim a stronger reliability and robustness analysis.

This is BTP-ready if presented as a rigorous negative/robustness study. It is not ready as a clinical diagnostic or high-accuracy detector paper.

- External transfer remains weak, so deployment claims are not supported.
